# Champ And Little Man

A collaborative puzzle-solving game with my kids as the main characters. It's really just an exercise in learning [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), so whether this truly makes it to the status of "game" is yet to be determined, but it'll be fun finding out if it does.
